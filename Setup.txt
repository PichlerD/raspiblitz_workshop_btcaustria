Setup without using a copy station

1. Plug in the new HDD/SSD you want to use for the new Raspiblitz into a Ubuntu System

2. Via the internal tool Format it to EXT4 name the drive BLOCKCHAIN

3. Get a raspiblitz previously used active hdd/ssd and plug it into the same system

4. Open nautilus in Sudo
"sudo nautilus" enter password
navigate to the hdds in my case
"Other Locations" -> "media" -> my_username -> "Blockchain" for the old hdd
"Other Locations" -> "media" -> my_username -> "Blockchain1" for the new hdd


5. Copy the 
bitcoin/chainstate and
bitcoin/blocks
from the old harddrive to the new harddrive
don't copy any other folder

6. 
The new hdd should now only have 1 folder named "bitcoin" including 2 other folders with files
Also make sure that "bitcoin" is written in lowercase letters this is case sensitive!

7. Now you have to change writting rights! or it won't work. open a terminal in the hdd location
Should look like this
USER@COMPUTER:/media/dm/BLOCKCHAIN1$
and enter
"sudo chmod 777 /*" 
to change all harddrivefiles to be writeable by any user (also the raspiblitz)

---

HDD should now be ready

1. For the SD-Card simply download 
Etcher https://www.balena.io/etcher/ 
and the Raspiblitz image currently 1.3
https://raspiblitz.com/raspiblitz-v1.3-2019-09-05.img.gz

2. Open up etcher choose the raspiblitz file and your SD-Card

3. This process should take around 5 Minutes

Insert both into your raspiblitz hardware and now start the setup via ssh
ssh admin@IP Address
